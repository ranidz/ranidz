## Technical Expertise

My technology stack is focused on building high-performance, scalable applications with clean, maintainable code. I work extensively with React for crafting interactive user interfaces and Vue.js for component-based frontend architectures. For styling, I utilize Tailwind CSS alongside traditional HTML and CSS to create responsive, modern designs that scale across devices.

On the backend, I specialize in building robust systems using Express.js and NestJS for enterprise-grade Node.js applications, and Go with the Fiber framework for high-performance services with minimal resource overhead. I have experience with both monolithic and microservices architectures, understanding the trade-offs and design patterns for each approach. For inter-service communication, I work with gRPC for efficient, type-safe APIs and RabbitMQ for reliable message queuing and asynchronous processing. I also implement WebSockets for real-time, bidirectional communication in applications requiring live data updates.

I prioritize type safety and code quality through TypeScript and Java, ensuring maintainable codebases. Additionally, I work with Tauri to develop lightweight, secure desktop applications that bridge web technologies with native performance.

Beyond implementation, I am deeply invested in understanding core computer science concepts and software engineering principles. I am also actively exploring artificial intelligence and machine learning, integrating AI-driven solutions into modern applications to solve complex problems and enhance user experiences.
